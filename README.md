# Sozdik - Learn words effectively with OpenAI

## Local-first app

Sozdik or szdk is a local-first app, which means:
- no registration
- no paid mode
- no ads

which also means all user data will be saved in local storage.
In next versions I am planning to add some kinda sync engine to sync several user devices

## Run locally

```bash
# install
pnpm install

# dev
pnpm run dev

# build

pnpm run build
```
